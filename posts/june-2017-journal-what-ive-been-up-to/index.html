<p>Howdy folks! It’s been a while. I’ve kept myself busy this past month learning about different things in kubernetes and distributed systems. I’ve document most of it but I felt that nothing was worth a post that is until I found this article by Sam Jarman titled <a href="https://www.samjarman.co.nz/blog/online-presence?utm_content=bufferbe064&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">“Online Presence”</a>. The article talks about, you guessed it, online presence in its various forms(blogs, vlogs, github, etc) but what really caught my attention was a linked video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVKofRN1dyI">Gary Vaynerchuk’s Document, Don’t Create</a>. After the video Sam gives some tips on what to document and how to document as a developer. That’s what I’m going to do going forward: document my learning process, log my journey, tell my story.</p>
<h2 id=kubernetes-the-hard-way>Kubernetes the Hard Way</h2>
<p>Right after setting up the blog I was asking the recurring “Where to go next”. I decided to complete Kelsey Hightower’s <a href=https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way>Kubernetes The Hard Way</a> guide. In this guide we use GCP and since I spend all the credit in my main account I had to set up another trial in my old account. This time I’ll be more careful with clusters. Overall, the guide was straight-forward. I learned more about components and how many of them you need to bootstrap a cluster.</p>
<h2 id=running-workloads-in-kubernetes>Running Workloads in Kubernetes</h2>
<p>I learned about application patterns and how they’re addressed in k8s from Janet Kuo’s <a href=https://medium.com/google-cloud/running-workloads-in-kubernetes-86194d133593>Running Workloads in Kubernetes</a>. Turns out my blog project follows a “stateless pattern”. But there are also other patterns such as stateful, daemons, and batch. We do not set up datastore cluster the same way we schedule tasks. I will set up some quick projects with these patterns later on.</p>
<h2 id=the-log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying-abstraction>The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data’s unifying abstraction</h2>
<p>I cannot for the life of me remember where I found it, I guess that’s another good reason for  documenting often. I know it was in another article that referenced it as <em>if you take away anything from here let it be reading this excellent article.</em> So I did. Before reading, my concept of logging was more of an application log for humans to read. The author puts it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But before we get too far let me clarify something that is a bit confusing. Every programmer is familiar with another definition of logging—the unstructured error messages or trace info an application might write out to a local file using syslog or log4j. For clarity I will call this “application logging”. The application log is a degenerative form of the log concept I am describing. The biggest difference is that text logs are meant to be primarily for humans to read and the “journal” or “data logs” I’m describing are built for programmatic access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the article did teach me a better important lesson. Now when I have to design a system or a service I will consider a log centric approach. As a plus, I understood some of the ideas behind Apache kafka. So what are you waiting for go read <a href=https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying>The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data’s unifying abstraction</a>.</p>
<h2 id=consensus---orchestration---raft>Consensus -> Orchestration -> Raft</h2>
<p>So I learned about consensus in Coursera’s <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing>Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1</a> and then I  came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsv-q8WbIZY&feature=youtu.be">talk</a> about orchestration by Laura Frank. I really like it since it painted a picture of where consensus comes in for cluster orchestration. In k8s’ case in comes in etcd’s choice of the raft algorithm. My favorite part of the algorithm though is the <a href=https://raft.github.io/>website</a> because it gathers all the key information you need to understand it: papers, talks, courses, where to ask questions, and real-world examples. I found some interesting assignments in the courses listed to implement raft. I hope to give it a go further down the line but for now let me stay on k8s.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-next>Where to Next?</h2>
<p>One of my short-term career goals is to get involved in a OSS project and contribute. So after completing the guide and reading the articles I decided I want to contribute to k8s. I’ve already started working towards that goal. I found some good people willing to help out and a very interesting kubernetes SIG(Special Interest Group) but that’s story for another post. I want to advance further before sharing my experience. Sort of not to be jinxed. I’ll be documenting however. See you then.</p>
