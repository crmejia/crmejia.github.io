So this blog sat on the shelf for over a year and now I have decided to try Hugo, a static site generator. There are a few reasons:
* I want to structure my site a little diferrently than what Ghost allows me to do. 
* I was playing with the droplet that hosted the blog for another project and ended up borking the droplet. So instead of recreating, I want to have a cheaper option that's wasier to maintain.

I found a couple blog articles describing this exact problem of migrating so there's no use to repeat it to much. here are the blogs:
* https://blog.joaograssi.com/posts/2020/migrating-my-blog-from-ghost-to-hugo/
* https://dwmkerr.com/migrating-from-ghost-to-hugo/ 
* https://rmoff.net/2018/12/17/moving-from-ghost-to-hugo/

I did find ghostToHugo a bit unmainted. I ended up forking and making it work but to my suprise migration was not enough as I had to spent somethign reading about Hugo and making it work. This experience definetly deducts some point from the whole experience as it not seamless. One of the blog post did warn that it was going to take longer than expected to migrate.
