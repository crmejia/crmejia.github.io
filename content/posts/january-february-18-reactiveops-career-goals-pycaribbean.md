Long time no see. I’ve kept busy and also got great news. On the 5th of February, I started a job as a Site Reliability Engineer for ReactiveOps. I’m excited and grateful for this opportunity.

Getting a job in the area was one of my career goals for this year. My other goals for the year are:

- keep learning new stuff and blog about it.
- Talk about Kubernetes at local user group.
- Present at a tech conference(No subject yet).

### Kubeadm Guide Improvements

I revised the guide a little bit https://github.com/crmejia/kubeadm-centos7-bare-metal

### Monitoring and Observability

I did some reading on monitoring and observability. Mainly reading two great posts by [Cindy Sridharan](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct?source=post_header_lockup):

- Monitoring and Observability([here](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-and-observability-8417d1952e1c)).
- Monitoring in the time of Cloud Native ([here](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-in-the-time-of-cloud-native-c87c7a5bfa3e)).

### PyCaribbean 2018

I attended PyCaribbean here in Santo Domingo. I got a few fresh ideas but my favorite thing was that I was able to reconnect with the local community and identify where we stand in regards to infrastructure and devops.

### Conclusion

I’ve made this post to maintain the habit. Looking forward to a great year filled with learning, documenting, and sharing my knowledge. See you around!
