I help engineering teams build and operate reliable cloud infrastructure. I specialize in Kubernetes and Go, and I've been doing this work remotely for companies across the US and Europe for over a decade.

If your team is adopting Kubernetes, struggling with infrastructure reliability, or needs hands-on help with your cloud platform -- I can help.

### Kubernetes & Cloud Infrastructure

Most of my consulting work is Kubernetes-focused. I'm [CKA-certified](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) and have designed, deployed, and operated clusters across GKE, EKS, and bare metal.

What this looks like in practice:

- **Cluster design and deployment** -- Standing up production-ready Kubernetes clusters with the right architecture for your scale and budget
- **Platform hardening** -- Ingress, RBAC, network policies, monitoring, alerting, and logging configured properly from the start
- **Infrastructure as Code** -- Building and managing your cloud resources (AWS, GCP, Azure) with Terraform so your infrastructure is reproducible and auditable
- **CI/CD pipelines** -- Setting up delivery pipelines so your team ships with confidence
- **Infrastructure assessment** -- An honest review of your current setup with a clear report on what to fix, what to keep, and what to prioritize

### Go Development

I build backend services and tools in Go using test-driven development. If you need a Go developer who understands infrastructure, I can write code that is built to run in production from day one.

### How I work

I work fully remote and I've collaborated with teams across multiple timezones for years. Async communication, clear documentation, and reliable delivery are how I operate.

Engagements typically start with a conversation about what you need. From there, we figure out the right scope -- whether that's a one-time infrastructure assessment, a multi-week project, or ongoing support.
