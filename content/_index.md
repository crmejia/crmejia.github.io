### Howdy!

I'm Crismar -- a Site Reliability Engineer and Go developer. I help teams run reliable Kubernetes infrastructure, and I build things on the side.

I write about Go, Kubernetes, Terraform, and whatever I'm tinkering with. This blog is my journal -- documenting the journey, one deploy at a time.
