Hi! My name is Crismar and I’m a Site Reliability Engineer. I enjoy working on distributed systems and cloud technologies. This blog started as a _Hello World_ project with Kubernetes and evolved into a journal of my experiences as an engineer.

I’m currently working as a Cloud Consultant and Go Software Engineer. For more information checkout the [Consulting](/consulting) section.
