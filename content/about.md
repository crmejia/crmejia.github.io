I'm Crismar Mejia, a [CKA-certified](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) Site Reliability Engineer and Go developer. I've spent over a decade building and operating cloud infrastructure for teams across the US, Europe, and Latin America -- fully remote.

### What I do

I specialize in Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure. I've designed, deployed, and operated clusters across GKE, EKS, AWS, GCP, and Azure using Terraform, Helm, and the usual stack. I've done this at scale at companies like Goldman Sachs and Fairwinds, and as an independent consultant.

I also write Go. Most of my side projects are built with Go and TDD -- [CityGuide](https://hypermedia.guide) (a webapp for discovering cool spots in cities), a [habit tracker](https://github.com/crmejia/habit), and a few other things I'm tinkering with. I like building things from scratch and shipping them.

### This site

This blog started as a literal _Hello World_ -- I deployed WordPress on Kubernetes just to see if I could. It evolved into a journal where I document what I'm learning and building.

The domain `crismar.me` was chosen on purpose -- **Crismar Me**(jia). Yes, I'm that kind of engineer.

### Get in touch

I'm available for cloud consulting and Go contract work. If you have infrastructure that needs attention, [let's talk](/consulting).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crismarmoz/), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/CrismarMoz), and [GitHub](https://github.com/crmejia).
