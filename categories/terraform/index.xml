Also, I found an interesting book: Site Reliability Engineering by Google. So far I’ve read the intro and first chapter and I’m captivated. I want to take my career into SRE/DevOps and this book provides good insight. However, this post is about Terraform, I found a great blog and learned more about it.
The Case for Terraform I found a great series of posts by the engineers at Gruntwork called A Comprehensive Guide to Terraform.</description></item></channel></rss>
