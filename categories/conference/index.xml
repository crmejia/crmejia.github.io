I was selected in the second round, only 30 scholarships were offered at first. However, thanks to the efforts of the diversity committee they were able to offer 73 more scholarships. I’m very grateful for the diligence of these ladies to extend this amazing opportunity to more people.
103 attendees here this week received diversity scholarships!</description></item><item><title>My Hashiconf '17 Experience</title><link>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/my-hashiconf-17-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 21:58:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/my-hashiconf-17-experience/</guid><description>Last week I had the opportunity to attend Hashiconf ‘17 in Austin, Texas.
