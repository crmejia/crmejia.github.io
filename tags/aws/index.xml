Also, I found an interesting book: Site Reliability Engineering by Google. So far I’ve read the intro and first chapter and I’m captivated. I want to take my career into SRE/DevOps and this book provides good insight. However, this post is about Terraform, I found a great blog and learned more about it.
The Case for Terraform I found a great series of posts by the engineers at Gruntwork called A Comprehensive Guide to Terraform.</description></item><item><title>Creating Infrastructure with Terraform</title><link>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/creating-infrastructure-with-terraform/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2017 20:15:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/creating-infrastructure-with-terraform/</guid><description>I’m attending HashiConf ‘17, an annual tech conference from HashiCorp. I came across HashiCorp sometime ago when I was playing around with Vagrant, a neat tool for creating and managing dev environments using virtual machines. I became aware of the conference thanks to Twitter and reached out to the organizers asking if there was any financial aid or scholarships. Lucky for me, I was offered a complimentary ticket to attend. So here I come HashiConf ‘17!</description></item><item><title>AWS EC2 + Bitnami and HTTPS w/Let's Encrypt</title><link>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/aws-ec2-bitnami-and-https-wlets-encrypt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 20:07:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/aws-ec2-bitnami-and-https-wlets-encrypt/</guid><description>I ran out of credit for Google Cloud. Turns out running a cluster is quite expensive. For the sake of having a blog while I keep learning about kubernetes and other technologies I decided to go with a simpler(and cheaper) approach to blogging.
Enter AWS + Bitnami I chose to start AWS free trial and create a blog using the prepacked Bitnami solution. This deployment runs on a good ol’ VM and is cheap.</description></item></channel></rss>
