Turns out running a cluster is quite expensive. For the sake of having a blog while I keep learning about kubernetes and other technologies I decided to go with a simpler(and cheaper) approach to blogging.
Enter AWS + Bitnami I chose to start AWS free trial and create a blog using the prepacked Bitnami solution. This deployment runs on a good ol’ VM and is cheap.</description></item><item><title>Let There be a Domain</title><link>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/let-there-be-a-domain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 18:41:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://crmejia.github.io/posts/let-there-be-a-domain/</guid><description>Now that the blog is back up finally we can finally get around to setting up a domain. First thing we would need is a static IP to point the domain to. So let’s do.
Static IP on GKE for a Kubernetes Service I did not find an official guide on how to do this. Fortunately, I found a blog post and a Stack Overflow answer that explains how to accomplish this.</description></item><item><title>Blog Day 1.

Which I find odd since I’m still at 104.196.107.177 and only shared the IP with a friend. So I’m jumped on the cloud shell to have a looks at the pods logs:
$kubectl logs wordpress-3772071710-cn374

An expert in the field suggested I started small by setting up a WordPress blog using Kubernetes + Docker on a local machine or a cloud like a droplet from Digital Ocean or GKE from Google. So this is my journey setting up a blog.
Udacity 615: Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes I was debating where to start since I wasn’t familiar with Kubernetes or Docker.</description></item></channel></rss>
